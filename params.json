It provides a convenient command line interface for installing, switching, removing and listing Candidates.\r\n\r\nCandidates that will initially be supported are:\r\n\r\n*   Groovy\r\n*   Grails\r\n*   Griffon\r\n*   Gradle\r\n\r\nThis list will grow beyond Groovy candidates.\r\n\r\nSupported platforms are:\r\n\r\n*   Linux\r\n*   Mac OSX\r\n*   Cygwin\r\n*   Solaris\r\n*   FreeBSD (with bash installed)\r\n\r\nGVM only depends on bash, curl, zip and unzip to be present on your system. The installer will check for these before completing the installation process. It will then create a `.gvm` folder in your home directory, and neatly install all candidates beneath it.\r\n\r\nGVM also has a server-side component written with [vertx](http://vertx.io) enabling it's dynamic behavior. New available candidates and versions can be added to GVM without the need for local re-installation. It also facilitates easy installation and selfupdate of the client-side components as well as a facility for live notifications.\r\n\r\nThe server uses MongoDB for persisting candidates and gathering of usage statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nOpen your favourite bash terminal and enter the following:\r\n\r\n    curl -s beta.gvmtool.net | bash\r\n\r\nIf the environment needs tweaking for GVM to be installed, the installer will prompt you accordingly and ask you to restart.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nAfter installation, you will need to run the code snippet that the installer prompts you to. Alternatively you could open a new terminal. Now run the following:\r\n\r\n    Groovy enVironment Manager 0.4\r\n    GVM server 0.4 on vertx 1.2.3.final\r\n    \r\n    === BROADCAST ==========================================\r\n    Some live message...\r\n    ========================================================\r\n    \r\n    Usage: gvm <command> <candidate> [version]\r\n    \r\n       command   : install, uninstall, list, use, current, selfupdate or help\r\n       candidate : grails,groovy\r\n       version   : optional, defaults to latest stable if not provided\r\n    \r\n    eg: gvm install grails 2.1.0\r\n\r\nTo install the current default grails version, simply type:\r\n\r\n    gvm install grails\r\n\r\nand then:\r\n\r\n    gvm use grails\r\n\r\nThat's it! As easy as that!"}
